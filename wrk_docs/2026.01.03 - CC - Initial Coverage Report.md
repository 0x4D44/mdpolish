# Code Coverage Report - Cadet Shoe Polish Timer

**Date:** 2026-01-03
**Current Coverage:** 0%

## Executive Summary
A comprehensive review of the `mdpolish` repository, specifically the `polish-timer` application, reveals a complete absence of executable tests. While testing dependencies (`jest`, `@testing-library/react-native`) are present in `package.json`, there is no configuration file, no test scripts, and no `.test.tsx` or `.spec.ts` files within the codebase.

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Configuration
- **Jest Config:** Missing. No `jest.config.js` or similar found in project root.
- **Package Scripts:** Missing. `package.json` lacks `"test"` or `"test:coverage"` scripts.
- **Dependencies:** Present. `jest`, `ts-jest`, `react-test-renderer`, and `@testing-library/*` are installed.

### 2. Source Code Analysis
- **`src/utils/`**: Contains pure functions (storage, notifications) suitable for unit testing. Coverage: 0%.
- **`src/hooks/`**: Contains core business logic (`useTimer`, `useSession`). Critical path. Coverage: 0%.
- **`src/components/`**: UI components. Coverage: 0%.
- **`App.tsx`**: Main entry point. Coverage: 0%.

### 3. Gap Analysis
The application logic is entirely exposed to regression risks. There is no automated verification for:
- Timer accuracy and state transitions.
- Session persistence and recovery.
- UI state updates.

## Recommendations
Immediate action is required to bootstrap the testing environment and begin backfilling tests, prioritizing core business logic (hooks) and utility functions.
